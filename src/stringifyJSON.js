// this is what you would do if you liked things to be easy:
// var stringifyJSON = JSON.stringify;

// but you don't so you're going to write it from scratch:

var stringifyJSON = function(obj) {
  //mission: take in an obj and add each character to a string, return entire string
  //base case: no more elements in obj to add to string
  //remove the element you just added to your string from the obj
};
